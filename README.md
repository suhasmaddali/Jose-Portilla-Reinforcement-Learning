In this repository, the notebook that is used to learn the basics such as numpy and seaborn is written when I went through the videos of the course by Jose Portilla on Reinforcement Learning. 

Furthermore, all of the videos contained coding which I did in parallel while listening to the basics taught by Jose Portilla. Feel free to check out the notebook which contains all the code that is being explained on the videos. Thanks.
